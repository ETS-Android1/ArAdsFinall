This project is an augmented reality based android application. 
In this application, Vuforia APIs are being used to access augmented objects. 
The APIs used in this project are markerless and there are two basic methods being used for scanning products. 
These objects are then used to display augmented reality for specific products. 
These 3D augmented reality objects are basically used for generating AR view videos which are then used to display advertisments for the specific product.
